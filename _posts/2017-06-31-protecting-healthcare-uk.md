Our friends at 38 Degrees just shared an inspiring story about a local campaign to save hospital services, launched and run by their members on the Campaigns By You ControlShift platform. From their email:

After months and months of hard work, **a group of 38 Degrees members in Essex have saved their hospital’s A&E**. They proved to NHS bosses that the plan to downgrade Broomfield Accident & Emergency department was unpopular and dangerous. Now the plan has been [scrapped](http://www.essexlive.news/u-turn-victory-over-broomfield-a-e-plans/story-30449625-detail/story.html#s8tCxicHfMULF57I.99).

**Here’s how they did it:**

**November: Andy from Chelmsford sprung into action** when he heard about the threat to Broomfield A&E. He couldn’t accept that people in a life-threatening emergency would be forced to take a longer, riskier drive to another hospital. So **he [started a petition](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/defend-our-a-e-broomfield) on the 38 Degrees website and set up a Facebook page**.

**December: Andy’s petition had gathered thousands of supporters already!** Many of them wanted to roll up their sleeves too, so **together they set up petition stalls** to get even more signatures.

**January to March: Andy and the other campaigners organised a march for hundreds of people. Lots of other people** emailed the NHS bosses, demanding they scrap their plans, and **they delivered the 22,000-strong petition**.

**April to June: They organised lots more petition stalls and public meetings, including a hustings** to quiz council candidates on what they’d do to save the A&E. **The campaign kept hitting the front pages of local newspapers**, and loads of people wrote in to share why the A&E matters to them.

**Last Friday: NHS bosses announce that the A&E will be saved!** NHS boss Claire Panniker said that it was the “significant concerns” of so many people that made it happen — that’s the 30,000 people who supported Andy’s campaign.
