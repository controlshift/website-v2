During our most recent [office hours](https://youtu.be/wgRZwn2widA) we had the chance to show off [our new petition creation flow](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/2021/06/28/petition-creation-reloaded.html). We also spent some time talking about **the various strategies organizations can use to drive successful petition creation**. For many of our organizations, petitions are the primary way that members become leaders, and we know that organizations are often interested new ways to drive campaign growth.

### Getting Started

Before you dive into recruiting new campaign creators, you may want to first take a step back to ask some broader questions about your organization and why potential campaign leaders would want to create campaigns on your site instead of one of the other options available to them. What makes your organization special? Why should someone start a petition on your site, and what are you offering them in return? 

Maybe your organization's expertise in a particular issue area that sets you apart. Maybe you're the only platform that's operating natively in your country/language. Maybe you'll offer more organizing help to your petition leaders than the alternatives or you'll connect them with a broader base of ideologically-aligned potential supporters. Maybe your answer is "all of the above!" Regardless, thinking through what your organization's unique value is to petition leaders is a good place to start, and your answers will likely inform your recruitment strategies.

Similarly, think through what your organization hopes to get out of your distributed organizing. Member-led petitions have many benefits: 

* they allow organizations to scale their impact and potentially expand into new fights or new issues areas,
* they allow an organization to empower their members to become leaders and help prepare those supporters to take broader leadership opportunities,
* they drive growth, 
* they can provide new context or allow an organization to think and speak about an existing issue in new ways, 
* they allow an organization to find authentic stories from real people that are impacted by the issues we campaign on,
* they allow organizations to test more content. By asking supporters to start petitions, organizations increase the volume of content they can test to discover what content that supporters respond to positively.

Your organization may be interested in some or all of these benefits, but thinking about your specific goals for the member-led petitions you're supporting should inform what your recruitment (and your [ongoing campaign leader support](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/resources/getting-started-with-distributed-organizing-petitions)) process looks like. Answering these existential questions is one of the most important and essential steps to figuring out a recruitment strategy that will work well for your organization.



### Soliciting Campaigns By Email

* If you're not doing so already, consider adding a small recruitment ask to the footer of all of the emails you send. This can be something as simple as "Is there an issue you care about?" with a link to your petition creation page.
* Send rolling recruitment emails to your existing list asking them to create campaigns in their area. Asking a small percentage of your supporters to start a petition via email each week can help ensure a steady stream of petitions are launched. 
* Email your list asking them to sign existing member-led petitions. This is a great way to increase the reach of your member-led campaigns, while also modeling good campaigning. These emails work best when they tell the story of a petition creator who's just like the reader, who decided to launch a campaign on an issue important to them, and now needs the reader to help their efforts by signing the campaign. You can then easily 
* Do you see an issue in the news that would be a good campaign opportunity? Send a request to your list asking them to create a lead a campaign. Even if there is already a petition on an issue, this can be an interesting way to find new ways of talking about an issue, while also remind your existing supporters that the can be leaders too.
* Send a survey to your list asking them how much (1-5) they care about an issue or ask them a yes/no about whether your organization should campaign on that issue. When someone says that they care about the issue and/or think that your organization should campaign on it, immediately show them a petition creation ask. This allows your organization to get feedback from your supporters on what they care about, find out which segment of your list cares a lot about a specific issue, and also recruit new campaign leaders.  (*You can also consider collecting any campaigns that are generated into a [Landing Page](https://support.controlshiftlabs.com/hc/en-us/sections/206288068-Landing-Pages), which will allow people who care about the issue to quickly find other campaigns to sign.*)
