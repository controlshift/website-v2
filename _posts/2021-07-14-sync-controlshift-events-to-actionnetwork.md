We've added support to our ActionNetwork sync to allow customers to integrate ControlShift Events and Calendars with ActionNetwork Events and Event Campaigns via an API data sync.

It's now possible to use ControlShift to organize member-led days of action, house parties, canvasses or phone banks using our powerful distributed event tools, and have the data about those events and their attendees flow into ActionNetwork in real time as your supporters take action. This replaces the need to shuffle CSVs between the two systems and ensures that volunteers who attend an event immediately end up on your organization's mailing list in ActionNetwork. 

ActionNetwork customers organizing distributed event campaigns with ControlShift also have access to our beautiful organizing maps, powerful moderation tools for staff, and easy-to-use features that grassroots event hosts use to plan their event.

Existing customers who would like to enable the data sync with ActionNetwork should contact ControlShift Support.
