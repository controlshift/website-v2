We've added support to our [ActionNetwork](https://www.actionnetwork.org) sync to allow customers to integrate ControlShift Events and Calendars with ActionNetwork Events and Event Campaigns via an API data sync.

It's now possible to use ControlShift to organize member-led days of action, house parties, canvasses, phone banks or other sorts of events using our powerful distributed event tools, and have the data about those events and their attendees flow back into ActionNetwork in real time. This replaces the need for staff to shuffle CSVs between the two systems and ensures that volunteers who attend an event immediately end up on your organization's mailing list in ActionNetwork.

The data sync mirrors ControlShift activity into native ActionNetwork data types so you'll see the data organized within ActionNetwork as Events, Event Campaigns and attendee RSVPs, just as if the events were organized within ActionNetwork itself.  

ActionNetwork customers organizing distributed event campaigns with ControlShift benefit from our beautiful organizing maps, powerful moderation tools for staff, and easy-to-use features that grassroots event hosts can use to plan their event, as well as the event features of our member-led petition functionality.
