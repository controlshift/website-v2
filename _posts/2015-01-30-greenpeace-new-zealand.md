  Instead of a campaign of the week, we want to let you know about our newest ControlShift organization, Greenpeace New Zealand. Greenpeace New Zealand’s new distributed organizing platform, [TOKO](https://www.toko.org.nz), launched Thursday morning and has already garnered nearly 1,000 signatures site-wide.

On TOKO, you can create petitions aimed at creating a more fair, just, and sustainable world. If you’d like to start your own petition targeting an issue in New Zealand, visit [TOKO’s homepage](https://www.toko.org.nz).

We’re very excited to welcome GP NZ to the ControlShift family!
