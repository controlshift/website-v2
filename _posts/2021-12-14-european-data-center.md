We’ve always believed that customers and their supporters own their own data. We are simply stewards of that information in service of helping to make our customers more powerful in the world. 

We've also always been a very global organization: we initially got started in Australia, found our second customer in the UK and now serve customers around the world in more than a dozen languages and on every continent except Antartica. As part of our work to support diverse data privacy requirements we’ve long offered a variety of product features to help customers comply with data privacy regulations around the world, including GDPR in Europe. 

We’re excited to announce that we are now going a step further to offer new customers a choice of data-locality and processing within either our North America (Virginia, USA) or European (Frankfurt, DE) points of presence when they sign up for a new instance of the product. This new offering publicly available today makes it easier for customers to meet the data-locality requirements of their stakeholders. 

We are proud to now be one of only a handful of political software companies who are able to offer data storage in Europe for those who need it. 

While we are excited about the possibilities of this data hosting option for new customers, we unfortunately do not have current plans to provide the ability for existing customers to switch the data locality for existing accounts. Customers that started in our North American data center will remain there for the time being, and customers who sign up in Europe will not be able to change their mind and migrate to the United States. 

It is possible for existing customers to “start fresh” in a new data center of their choice without carrying across historical data or accounts, but this is often a difficult and impractical task for organizations with lots of historical campaigns, activity, and customization. If this is an option you would like to consider, please be in touch to plan your migration. 

If you're a new customer, just choose [Sign Up](https://go.controlshift.app/signups/new_for_location) in the header, and you'll be able to choose the right location for your project.
