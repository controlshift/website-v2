I enjoyed today's [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/2501/) which made the point that "experts in everything wildly overestimate the average person's familiarity with their field" and the same is as true for supporter-led petition platforms as it is for geochemistry. 

Behind the scenes we provide the white-labeled software-as-a-service that [dozens](https://sign.moveon.org/) [of](https://you.38degrees.org.uk) [organizations](https://weact.campact.de/) around the world use to power platforms where their supporters can launch their own petition campaigns. On the surface these sites are about democratizing access to the tools used to create petitions, opening up the tactic of launching a petition to local leaders, and supporting local activists with the tools they need to win their own fights. 

Behind the scenes however, our most sophisticated customers are actually using their platforms for message testing, issue identification and optimization. Supporter authored petitions are a great tactic for getting out of the professionalized campaigner bubble and finding the issues and ways of talking about them that are authentic and resonate. 

Instead of staff writing a petition on an issue themselves, they instead email dozens of their top supporters and ask them to write petitions in their own words on an issue of the moment. Those different variations in language, image choice and angle are then tested against one another by emailing them to small segments of an email list to see which ones gain the most traction. Promising petition campaigns are then refined further before pushing them out to a wide audience. 

Similarly having an open process for creating new petition campaigns can also help organizations identify campaign issues that they might not have been aware of or might have dismissed internally. 

[Dave Karpf](https://twitter.com/davekarpf) at George Washington University coined the term [Analytic Activism](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190266127.001.0001/acprof-9780190266127) to describe this process where advocacy organizations use A/B tests, analytics and large digital audiences to "listen" to their supporters and rapidly respond to identify opportunities to either grow their audience or find issues to activate it or find new ways to talk about it. 

As an ethical provider of software for democratic participation and progressive power building I do have some concerns about how far these tactics can be used and the ways that they contribute to the reduction of complicated policy issues into carefully optimized click-bait. On the other hand these strategies are not fundamentally different than other "listening" tactics like opinion polling -- they simply accelerate the speed with which advocacy organizations can test messages and transform them into public communications. The core insight is that by engaging supporters at scale, organizations can test more messages than they could possibly come up with as a paid staff. Whether the causes or their prescriptions that supporter led petitions can generate are worthwhile or simply viral on social media is a question for organizations to answer, as is whether this sort of analytic activism can be used for persuasion.
