As 2024 draws to a close, we're taking a look back at the year in organizing. With [the most voters in history ](https://time.com/6550920/world-elections-2024/)heading to the polls this year, many of our customers were working to mobilize voters and fight back against misinformation and voter apathy. Throughout the world, we had some exciting successes and some gut wrenching losses.

Amidst headline grabbing electoral fights, all of our organizations were simultaneously working hard to ensure that progressive ideals had wins both big and small. Here's a selection of the campaigns we saw in the last year:

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º In Australia, the Victorian Trades Hall Council and the Migrant Workers Centre had a big win for worker protections. Due to [their campaigning](https://www.megaphone.org.au/petitions/exploited-worker-guarantee-protection-against-cancellation), the Australian government introduced a workplace justice visa. **This visa allows migrant workers who file a complaint against their employer to remain in the country for 12 months during legal actions and maintain full work rights during that period.** 

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Also in Australia, teaching students are required to complete up to 80 days of practicum placements. These placements were unpaid, which made it difficult for students with financial responsibilities. **Thanks to the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Australian Education Union, and almost [14,000 Megaphone supporters](https://www.megaphone.org.au/petitions/paid-placements-for-all-pre-service-teachers), the practicum placements will now be paid.** 

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ 350 Canada ran a **large campaign in** [**support of universal, free heat pump program**.](https://community.350.org/efforts/heat-pumps-for-all/lookup/new) The campaign will continue in 2025, and the 350 team has already won the support of numerous Members of Parliament from multiple parties. 

ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º In Hungary, aHang members learned that [two state-funded schools would be privatized](https://szabad.ahang.hu/petitions/mentsuk-meg-a-tamasi-aron-iskolat) with very short notice, requiring parents to pay tuition for their children to attend. This included[ one of the top-rated schools in the country](https://szabad.ahang.hu/petitions/vedjuk-meg-a-veres-peter-gimnaziumot). Then [more than 12,000 aHanag members jumped into action](https://ahang.hu/iranytu) â€“ **they prevented the last minute change and ensured that the schools remained state-funded and free for parents and students.**

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª In Ireland, an investigation by RTÃ‰ uncovered **abusive behavior at a horse abattoir in Kildare**.

ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± In the Netherlands, [13,000 DeGoedeZaak supporters signed](https://actie.degoedezaak.org/petitions/behoud-de-bed-bad-brood-in-rotterdam) a petition in support of the "Bed Bad Brood" ("Bed Bath Bread") program in Rotterdam which provides housing, food, and opportunities for undocumented residents. The program had been on the government's chopping block, with **45 residents to lose access to housing and support on on 1 January. The DeGoedeZaak petition increased visibility into the issue and the program will continue.**

ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ In New Zealand, stalking is not a crime. ActionStation members, together with the Coalition for the Safety of Women and Children, **organized more than 20,000 supporters to pressure the Minister of Justice to make anti-stalking legislation a priority.** Months later, the new legislation has been introduced and passed its first reading. 

ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ In Romania, the Vrancea County Students' Council [created a campaign because multiple schools had no heat amidst falling temperatures in November](https://campaniamea.de-clic.ro/petitions/solicitam-trecerea-la-invatamantul-online). By successfully calling attention to the issue and rallying the support of more than 1,000 Declic signers, **the students were able to get the heating debts paid, the heat turned on for most of the schools, and classes moved online for the non-heated school**.

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­In Switzerland, [more than 17,000 Campax supporters](https://act.campax.org/petitions/kurzungen-bei-der-frauen-em-rote-karte-fur-den-bundesrat) demanded and won an increase in funding for the Women's European Championship 2025. The tournament is a flagship project for Swiss football and the **increased funding demonstrates commitment to women's sport.**

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ In the US, San Diego flooding displaced more than 900 households. An emergency housing voucher program was set expire when [MoveOn members jumped into action](https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/extended-hotel-vouchers-for-san-diego-flood-victims). **Pressure from supporters led to the board of supervisors committing an additional $9.6 million in food and housing vouchers for flood victims.**
