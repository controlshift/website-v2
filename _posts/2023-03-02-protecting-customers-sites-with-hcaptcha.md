Successfully protecting ControlShift sites from bots and malicious actors requires multiple layers of protection. While many of these protections are behind-the-scenes, we've long recommended that organizations also enable captcha-based bot protections on their site's public-facing forms. 

C﻿aptchas can take a few forms: the most familiar versions involve showing a user a set of images and asking them to click any images that match a specific description (e.g. click all the bridges or all the taxis). More modern captchas are largely invisible to the user – they track things like cursor movements to determine if the user is a real person.

T﻿he most common captcha tool is reCAPTCHA, a free product offered by Google. We've allowed organizations to integrate with reCAPTCHA for years, but for some organizations, Google's product introduced data privacy concerns that made using the product untenable.

With data privacy in mind, we've rolled out support for integrating with [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/)h﻿Captcha is a paid tool that describes itself as a privacy-first alternative to tools like reCAPTCHA. hCaptcha supports visible and invisible challenges to protect site forms from bots and other malicious actors. Organizations interested in using the tool can easily add it to their site from their [organization's Settings > Integrations page](https://support.controlshiftlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/5777373938959).

S﻿ecuring ControlShift's sites, and our organizations' supporter data, is our top priority. By allowing organizations to integrate with hCaptcha, we're ensuring that organizations are able to add additional layers of protection to their site while also upholding important data privacy requirements.
