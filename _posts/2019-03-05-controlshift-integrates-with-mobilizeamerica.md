Weâ€™re always excited about new organizing tools and work hard to integrate with all of the other platforms in the ecosystem. Some of our clients in the United States are using [MobilizeAmerica](https://www.mobilizeamerica.io) for event syndication while using ControlShift for organizing so we are pleased to announce an integration with their platform.

![](/img/1*tFLZPPXl3LaId6ELJx2j9g.png)Using the integration you can display events that are part of your MobilizeAmerica feed on the same map alongside distributed events created within ControlShift. This allows our customers to work with partners to syndicate events while giving volunteers a welcoming front door that includes all of the ways that they can get involved locally.

Our integration with MobilizeAmerica joins existing integrations with other parts of the progressive ecosystem like [ActionKit](https://www.actionkit.com/), [EveryAction](https://www.everyaction.com), [VAN](https://www.ngpvan.com/), [Blue State Digital](https://www.bluestatedigital.com/), [Salsa](https://www.salsalabs.com/), [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com/) and [EngagingNetworks](https://www.engagingnetworks.net) as well as our [developer API and data warehouse](https://developers.controlshiftlabs.com/) integrations. We play well with everyone and exist to build the best distributed organizing platform for all organizations in the movement regardless of the other vendors they may use.
