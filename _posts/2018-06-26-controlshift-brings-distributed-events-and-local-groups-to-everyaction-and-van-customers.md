We’re proud to announce that we’ve released a data integration that allows [EveryAction](http://www.everyaction.com/) and [VAN](http://www.ngpvan.com/) customers to seamlessly sync data from our distributed events, local groups, and member campaign features into their CRM and voter file.

![](/img/1*E_9bWxMv7Kw4RFmXN2ewww.png)We’re excited about this new integration because we think that it unlocks new organizing tactics for Democratic campaigns and their allies who working to win the upcoming mid-term elections. Our philosophy is that organizing needs to be more participatory and distributed.

### Distributed Events

While VAN and EveryAction both include basic tools for staff-created events, the ControlShift toolset allows your campaign to ask supporters to create their own events — either on an ad-hoc basis or as part of a day of action you organize with hundreds of supporter-initiated events. Members can use our search pages to find the closest upcoming events or host their own.

Each event host has tools to communicate with their attendees and track who attends — with all of the data automatically flowing into VAN/EveryAction. For admins, our powerful moderation features keep your team in control.

We’re excited to see campaigns adopt this tool to support distributed phonebank and canvass events that put people at the center of their organizing.

### Local Groups

Our local groups feature supports local volunteer teams, which are tied to a particular geographic turf, with a mailing list and the ability to host their own events. The events that the group hosts helps to grow the team. Our lookup pages help incoming volunteers find their turf and each team can organize locally to win.

As a campaign staffer, you’ll be able to see all of your local teams and moderate their activities. All of the local group participants are synchronized to EveryAction/VAN and tagged with their local group.

We think this new EveryAction/VAN integration will make possible a whole bunch of organizing tactics that are not possible out of the box. If you’re interested in learning more, [please get in touch](mailto:talk@controlshiftlabs.com).
