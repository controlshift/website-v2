A big congratulations to all of the ControlShift customers who have worked for years to stop the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. It was a long fight, but you [proved the power of organizing](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/obama-expected-to-reject-construction-of-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.html). Thanks for all of the great work you do — it’s an honor to help support you!
