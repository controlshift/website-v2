We’ve had an Engaging Networks integration for several years but we’re excited to announce that we’ve rewritten our integration from the ground up on top of the [Engaging Networks Services REST API](https://support.engagingnetworks.net/engaging-networks-services-ens).

The re-launched integration allows Engaging Networks customers to use the ControlShift platform for [member led campaigns](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/feature/campaigns/), [distributed events](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/feature/events/), and [local groups](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/feature/groups/) while using Engaging Networks as their CRM.

[Amnesty Canada](https://www.amnesty.ca) recently used ControlShift alongside Engaging Networks to organize Write for Rights a distributed day of action on International Human Rights Day. Supporters hosted hundreds of events across Canada where volunteers wrote letters in support of prisoners of conscience.

When enabled, the data integration adds supporters who take action on ControlShift to your Engaging Networks database automatically in real time. This saves your staff from needing to shuffle CSVs to keep your organizing tools in sync.

ControlShift enables several new organizing tactics for Engaging Networks customers:

* **Distributed Events** Allow your supporters to organize their own distributed events, phone banks, canvasses, house parties or community meetings.
* **Local Groups** Organize your supporters into geographic teams that are organizing offline. Each team can communicate internally and host events, while your organization manages all of the local activity.
* **Member Led Campaigns** open up your campaigning by allowing your supporters to [start their own campaigns](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/case-study/350/), or [take on hundreds of local campaigns at once by recruiting your members to lead them.](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/case-study/color-of-change/)
We’ve also released an open-source [ruby gem for the ENS REST API](https://github.com/controlshift/engaging-networks-rest/) that other software engineers can use to build integrations of their own.
