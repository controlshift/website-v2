We recently [announced our redesign of the petition creation flow](https://mailchi.mp/controlshiftlabs/petition-creation-reloaded)! This redesign is the latest in our series of public-facing page improvements, aimed at making the platform experience faster and better for our organizations' supporters. We kicked off this work by [working to improve page load speeds](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/2021/03/04/lighting-fast-pages.html) and then implemented [optimizations to the after-action sharing modals](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/2021/04/13/after-action-improvements.html).

The redesign of the petition creation flow is our most ambitious set of improvements so far. Most of our organizations are heavily focused on member-led petition campaigns, and we needed to ensure that our new designs increased successfully-created, high-quality petitions.

The new flow uses a [typeform-inspired](https://www.typeform.com/) mobile-first design to guide petition creators through each question on the petition creation form – giving them more context and direction as they move through the form. The new and fully-customizable text fields allow organizations to further refine the experience and customize it for their organization's needs. The new flow also streamlines the launch process by removing the review step and allowing petition creators to log in and publish their new campaign in single step.

During redesign process, we A/B tested individual elements and the complete flow against our previous petition creation page to ensure that our thoughts about areas for improvement were correct. During the testing phase, supporters at various organizations were randomly assigned to see either the new or old versions of the flow. Our tests showed that the **new petition creation flow increased conversions by 23%**!

Given the increase in the percentage of completed petitions, we're excited to have rolled out the redesigned flow to all of our organizations. We're also continuing our testing and refinements. Currently, we're testing a feature that allows prospective petition creators to ask for help as they move through the form. We showed a preview of this new experience during our recent [office hours](https://youtu.be/wgRZwn2widA). \

We're so excited to be making this new experience available to all of our organizations, and we'll be continuing our testing and improvements going forward – keep an eye out for future announcements!
