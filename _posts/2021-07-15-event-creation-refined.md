We've taken many of the lessons from our project to redesign the process of creating a petition on the ControlShift platform from the ground up and applied the best of them to the process of creating an event for others to attend.

While the two processes are somewhat similar, we decided that some that it was more important to see all of the fields that make up an event all at once rather than the linear process of progressively revealing form elements that our petition form uses. This is because so many of the elements relate to one another: the location determines the time zone for the event, as is the day and time. blah blah something something.
