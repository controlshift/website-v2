🇮🇪 In Ireland the government had announced that state-funded HRT would be made available to peri-menopausal and menopausal women. Then they walked it back. [More than 1,500 Uplift supporters jumped into action](https://my.uplift.ie/petitions/state-funded-hrt-as-promised-budget-2025) to ensure that the government followed through on the previous promise, and **within a month, state-funded HRT was available.** 

🇮🇪 Also in Ireland, Camogie players and supporters came together to push back on an outdated rule that prevented the girls and women who play the sport from wearing shorts. After [more than 6,500 supporters joined the campaign](https://my.uplift.ie/petitions/give-camogie-players-the-choice-to-wear-shorts), the Camogie Association announced that players would be given the option of skorts or shorts. 

🇳🇿 In Auckland, students receive discounts on public transit. For students below the university level, tickets are discounted by 40% but for university students, the discount was only 20%. This led to some university students spending more than a third of their budget on public transit. T[he Auckland University of Technology Students Association created a petition on Our ActionStation](https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/fair-fares-now-1) and **after more than 4,500 supporters joined the appeal, the Auckland Transport announced that university student rates would now be discounted by 40%.**

🇸🇪 Simret Tekiewas fighting for a residence permit that would allow him to stay in Sweden. His wife had been killed in a mass shooting, which caused the migration board to pause his application for residency.

After the petition hit the media, the migration board announced that he'd be allowed to stay.** 



 🇬🇧 In the UK, [more than 93,500 38 Degrees supporters came together](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/stop-employers-covering-up-abuse-1) to ban the use of NDAs to silence employees reporting harassment and discrimination.
