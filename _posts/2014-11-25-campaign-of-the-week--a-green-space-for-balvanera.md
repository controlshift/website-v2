This weekâ€™s campaign comes from [HagamosEco.org](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hagamoseco.org%2F&t=NGU4OTE2MjU1MmIwNjViZDc5Njc4NTZhZTI1YzUxMWY0NTIwNzk1ZCx1cnpJTzZEZQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AFXw8Xto7fd-MtUhR45PfSw&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcontrolshiftblog.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F104295962941%2Fcampaign-of-the-week-a-green-space-for-balvanera&m=1), a ControlShift-powered site run by Greenpeace Argentina. Hagamos Eco allows people in Argentina, and around the region, to start and run campaigns on environmental issues.

Using the toolset, a resident of Buenos Aires [created a petition](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hagamoseco.org%2Fpetitions%2Fun-espacio-verde-para-el-barrio-de-balvanera&t=OGFiZWU5NDc3MGE2NzVjNTk1MzJjZDk0Mjc1MzEwYWFiNThmYjFjYix1cnpJTzZEZQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AFXw8Xto7fd-MtUhR45PfSw&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcontrolshiftblog.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F104295962941%2Fcampaign-of-the-week-a-green-space-for-balvanera&m=1) asking the Mayor of Buenos Aires to allocate a disused parcel of land to be a green space, instead of a stadium. The proposed stadium would accommodate 18,000 people and have three underground parking lots. Opponents of the proposed structure state that it would have an negative environmental impact and would weaken the foundations of existing structures in the neighborhood.

In the last month, more than 3,500 people signed the petition in support of converting the lot to the green space.
