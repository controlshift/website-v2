From the beginning, ControlShift has been dedicated to the idea that the organizations and movements we support are most powerful when supporters take the lead – using their authentic voices and experiences to drive movements forward. At ControlShift's inception, opportunities for member leadership were limited to online petition campaigns. As we grew, we added events and groups – allowing supporters to take their actions offline and into the real world.

**The local groups toolset was built to make space for longer-running, sustained supporter led actions.** These local groups allow supporters to meet their neighbors, build connections, and keep working toward progress together beyond the bounds of a single petition or event. We think that the ability to build real community among supporters is incredibly powerful and especially important given the scale of the fights we're all working on. 

**We've spent the last few months working to make the groups tools more powerful and more user friendly.** This has been a huge project – overhauling most of the existing group pages and adding new functionality for group organizers. **While we're not done making improvements, we wanted to share some of the exciting new updates that we've rolled out recently.**

The most visible set of changes are the redesigned and modernized group pages for members and organizers. We worked with a design firm for user research and design improvements. The new designs are cleaner, more modern, and easier to interact with especially for mobile users.

We also wanted to be sure we were highlighting group's offline actions more effectively. The new designs have dedicated pages showcasing upcoming (and past) events, along with active (and ended) petitions. Ensuring that existing and prospective group members can see the various ways the group is taking action in their community.

Maintaining a group's momentum can be difficult, so we wanted to also include encouragement and tips for organizers. In the new designs, organizers will see prompts to create new events, petitions, resource pages, and posts.

We've also moved [resources](https://support.controlshiftlabs.com/article/386-members-experience-of-groups#resources) up the page when present. This allows the organizer-created evergreen pages to be more easily accessible for group members.
