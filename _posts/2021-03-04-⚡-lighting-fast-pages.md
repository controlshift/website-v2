Front-end page performance might seem like an obscure technical aspect of a product but it can be one of the most critical metrics that drives the success of any site. It's particularly important for mobile users whose constrained bandwidth and device capacity can make platforms that otherwise perform well feel frustratingly slow to load. In one often cited study, the BBC found that they lost an additional 10% of users for each additional second it took for a page to load. 

On one level front-end page performance is about conversions: the faster we make our pages, the more people will take action by signing a petition or creating an event. \

It's also about equity: Pages that are fast regardless of the mobile device or bandwidth available reach more people wherever they might live or how old their phones might be. 

Finally it's about search: Google and other search engines prioritize sites that load quickly while sorting results. Sites that Google notices perform well will rise in the rankings.
