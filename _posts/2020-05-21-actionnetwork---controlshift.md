  ![](/img/1*aJ5CJtHIMeopACoiq1Aj_Q.png)We now support a deep integration with [ActionNetwork](https://www.actionnetwork.org/) so our mutual customers can use our distributed organizing and member led campaigning tools alongside the ActionNetwork CRM and mailer.

The new integration syncs data to ActionNetwork in real time and ensures new action takers immediately end up on your email list, unsubscribes are transferred appropriately and supporter are tagged correctly so you can target them to receive messages based on the campaigns that they took action on.

We’re excited to add ActionNetwork to the list of CRMs we integrate with since they share our commitment to building progressive power and support many of the same movements that we do in our own work. ActionNetwork customers can now organize using our member led petition campaigns, local organizing groups and distributed events.

If you’re interested in setting up this integration, [contact ControlShift support](mailto:support@controlshiftlabs.com).
