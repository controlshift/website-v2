We're excited to announce a series of updates to ControlShift's themes feature!

**Themes allow organizations to control the look and feel of the platform by customizing the site's fonts, colors, logos, and links.** Previously, ControlShift supported only one theme at a time, meaning that all pages within the platform shared the same fonts and colors.

With our recent updates, we now allow organizations to create multiple themes, which can be assigned to different pages. **This allows organizations to more fully customize their supporters' journeys and create custom experiences for different types of petitions, events, and groups.**

While there are many ways the themes tools can be used, here are some uses that we're particularly excited to be able to support: 

* When a ControlShift organization is partnering with another organization, they can now **create a custom partner theme** for that partner's hub, petitions, and events pages. The custom theme could include some of the partner's colors, a modified logo, or header/footer links to the partner's main site. By assigning the theme within the partnership's settings, newly-created petitions and events in that partnership will automatically be assigned that theme.
* When an **organization is running \[a day of action](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/feature/events/) with its own brand**, they can now create a custom theme that's assigned to the ControlShift calendar. This custom theme can include the day of action's logo, colors, and links to external toolkits. By assigning the theme in the \[calendar's settings](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/feature/events/), newly-created events will be automatically be assigned that theme. This can be particularly helpful if the day of action has its own microsite or other web presences. By keeping the brand consistent as supporters move from different sites into ControlShift, we can help ensure a seamless experience.
* Some organizations create **microsites dedicated to specific types of petition campaigns** â€“ whether they're \[templatized petition campaigns targeting local leaders](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/feature/campaigns/efforts/) or petitions related to a specific issue. Organizations can now create custom themes that match that microsite's design and link back to the microsite. Like with a day of action, this can help ensure a consistent experience as supporters move between different sites.
* Organizations using ControlShift for both member-generated and staff-run petitions sometimes wish to separate officially-sponsored organizational campaigns from campaigns created by their supporters. These organizations can now **create an "official campaign" theme** that allows these special staff-run campaigns to stand out. 
* Some organizations have **separate legal identities that each have their own brand**. With the new themes features, these organizations can create a unique theme for each legal identity, and then assign it to petitions, events, or local groups accordingly. Because we also allow themes to be assigned to hostnames, these organizations can ensure that anyone viewing the site using a custom URL will see the appropriate branding.

We're excited to be sharing these new features.
