In accordance with §4.1 of of ChangeSprout Inc.'s Data Processing Addendum, ChangeSprout maintains a list of authorized subprocessors whom we have contracted to provide certain services related to the ControlShift toolset. 

When ChangeSprout updates its subprocessors, the list on this page will be updated (which will serve as "reasonable prior notice"). If your organization objects to the use of a proposed subprocessor, you may [send us an email](mailto:support@controlshiftlabs.com) detailing the reasons for your objection. 

Because updates to subprocessors will only be posted on this page, we'd encourage organizations to **subscribe** to updates using the form at the bottom of this page.

ChangeSprout has two categories of authorized Subprocessors of personal data. Subprocessors that we use to provision the core ControlShift product to you are categorized as "Infrastructure". Subprocessors that we use to help us answer support questions from customers are categorized as "Support".
