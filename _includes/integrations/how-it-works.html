  <h4>How does ControlShift work with {{include.crm_name}}?</h4>
  <p>
    We seamlessly sync supporters in real-time as they take action. There is no need
    for manual data entry or messy and time consuming CSV imports.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within {{include.crm_name}}, you'll be able to see which campaigns supporters have taken action on and immediately send
    emails targeting them based on the campaigns they've participated in on ControlShift.
