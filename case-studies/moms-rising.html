    <p><a href="https://www.momsrising.org/">MomsRising</a> noticed an issue taking off: across Europe and Australia, flashy protests were flaring up about unfair taxes on women’s products. These products — like tampons — were considered “unessential” and therefore subject to taxes, while other health and medical products were tax exempt. These protests were getting a lot of attention on social media and spreading to other countries.</p>
