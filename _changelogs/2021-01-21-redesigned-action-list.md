We've redesigned the admin petition signature page. The new page makes it easier to clearly see signature sources and makes the design consistent with other lists in the platform.

* It's now possible to export a CSV of all sources and buckets that have been used with a petition.
* It's now possible to export a Delivery PDF as an admin, even when this feature is disabled for petition creators.
* We've improved the page's mobile responsiveness.
