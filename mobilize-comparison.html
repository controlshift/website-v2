        <h4>Mobilize America vs ControlShift</h4>

        <p>
          When it comes to building grassroots power, there’s no shortage of digital tools to connect members to engagement
          opportunities. But are the tools you’re using meeting all your organizing needs?
        </p>

        <p>
          During the 2018 midterms, many Democratic campaigns and Democratic-aligned groups used MobilizeAmerica tools to
          recruit
          volunteers. Thanks to their event syndication tools, Democratic candidates could post volunteer opportunities, and
          Democratic superpacs could recruit their members, without violating federal laws about illegal co-ordination.
        </p>

        <p>
          But political campaigns can’t afford to leave any grassroots power on the table, and event syndication is just one way
          for campaigns to recruit supporters. As distributed campaigns like Beto O’Rourke’s Senate campaign showed, campaigns
          can
          take off when their supporters are empowered to take leadership, host their own events, and recruit from their own
          networks. But campaigns can only do that with scalable, intuitive tech for moderating and managing their volunteers.
