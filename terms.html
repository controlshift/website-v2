While these Terms may, from time to time, make collective references to a provision applying to Customer and its Users, Customer agrees that all obligations imposed on Customer under these Terms (or with respect to Customer’s Data) shall apply equally to each of Customer’s Users, regardless of whether expressly stated herein.

Customer agrees that the Company may also access, preserve and disclose Customer’s (and its Users) account information, related contents, and any other Customer Data if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any Customer Data violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to Customer’s requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of ControlShift, its users, or the public.
