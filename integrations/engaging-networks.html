          ControlShift enables new organizing tactics for Engaging Networks customers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Distributed Events</strong>
            Allow your supporters to organize their own distributed events, phone banks, canvasses, house parties or community meetings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Groups</strong>
            Organize your supporters into geographic teams that are organizing offline. Each team can communicate internally
            and host events, while your organization manages all of the local activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Member Led Campaigns</strong>
            open up your campaigning by allowing your supporters to [start their own campaigns](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/case-study/350/), or [take on hundreds of local campaigns at once by recruiting your members to lead them.](https://www.controlshiftlabs.com/case-study/color-of-change/)
          </li>
        </ul>
